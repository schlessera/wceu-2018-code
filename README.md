# Dependency Injection and Design Patterns in Real Life - Code Repository

This is the code repository for the WordCamp Europe 2018 Workshop ["Dependency Injection and Design Patterns in Real Life"](https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/session/dependency-injection-and-design-patterns-in-real-life/) presented by [David Mosterd](https://twitter.com/davidmosterd) and [Alain Schlesser](https://twitter.com/schlessera).

## 🖊 Abstract

> You know a lot of pattern buzzwords and OOP syntax, but fail to get actual benefits out of their practical use? You’ve read about principles and best practices but cannot apply them to your daily problems? We’ll work on a simple WordPress plugin to discuss fundamental principles like dependency injection and discover useful design patterns that solve real pain points in your development work. We’ll combine these techniques to give you strategies to better deal with ever-changing requirements.

> This workshop assumes solid knowledge of PHP and basic knowledge about classes and objects, how the PHP OOP syntax works and what the notions of polymorphism, encapsulation and inheritance mean.
